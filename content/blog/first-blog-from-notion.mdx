In this blog, I will explain how this stuff in notion works. I would like to see how notion converts
my text into blog posts etc. And I would like to see how embeddings like images work
in next js and notion.

Here are the things I will explain:
## First thing:

- one
- two three
1. one
2. two

This above is a demonstration of this stuff.

`const x = 5`

`const y = 100`

`const c = 5 + 100`

`console.log(c)`

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <div>Arham Gill</div>;
}

```

ok so this is the end.

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this post, I'll share my experience learning Next.js and why I love it.
## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features out of the box:

- **Server-side rendering** for better performance
- **File-based routing** that's intuitive
- **API routes** built right in
- **Optimized images** automatically

## My First Project

I decided to build my portfolio using Next.js, and it was an amazing experience. The App Router made organizing my code simple, and the built-in optimizations meant I didn't have to worry about performance.

## What's Next?

I'm excited to continue exploring Next.js features like Server Components and Server Actions. Stay tuned for more posts!

The web development landscape is constantly evolving. Here's what I've noticed in 2025 that's making waves in our industry.

## The Rise of Server Components

React Server Components are changing how we think about building applications. They allow us to:

TypeScript has become the standard. Even small projects benefit from the type safety and better developer experience it provides.

## AI-Assisted Development

AI tools are now an integral part of my workflow. They help with:

- Writing boilerplate code faster
- Debugging complex issues
- Learning new technologies

## Conclusion

It's an exciting time to be a web developer. The tools keep getting better, and the possibilities are endless!
